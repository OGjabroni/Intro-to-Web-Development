                <h2>Project Proposal</h2>
                <article>
                    <h3>Theme</h3>
                    <p>For my final project, I will be creating a personal website for my girlfriend, 
                        and her potential business partner, personal blog about Salesforce Marketing Cloud (SFMC),
                         and as a vehicle for self promotion with their consulting aspirations, and potentially acquiring new customers beyond their current clientele. </p>
                </article>
                <article>
                    <h3>Prime Objective</h3>
                    <p>The primary objective of the page is to create a self promotional knowledge sharing platform with the secondary objective
                     to sway potential customers away from the competition. </p>
                
                <figure>
                    <img id="profits" src="../img/profitsonlygoup.jpg" alt= "profitchart">
                    <figcaption> As seen here, profits that will make a Ferengi blush</figcaption>
                </figure>
                </article>
                    
                <article>
                    <h3>Audience</h3>
                    <p>The ideal audience would be individuals or companies looking for support with SFMC, 
                        they would be already knowledgeable about what Salesforce is, but are possibly looking for help/support in implementation, 
                        best practises, and use cases for the technology. 
                    </p>
                </article>
                <article>
                    <h3>Information Architecture</h3>
                    <p>The site will be set up like many similar blog sites for self promotion and information sharing including:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Home page</li>
                        <li>2 seperate blog post (articles) pages including a 3rd lorem ipsum blog</li>
                        <li>An about us page </li>
                        <li>A Contact us page with forms</li>
                    </ul>
                   
                    <figure>
                        <img id="navmindmap" src="../img/navplan.png" alt= "navmap">
                        <figcaption> Mind map of the nav linking</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>The home page will be a basic introduction, what the site is about, and some imagery.
                        The blog posts will be simple, text emphasized posts with corresponding imagery and links.
                        The about us page with include a simple resume of each person, and portraits of the individuals.
                        I'm hoping to make a contact form where people interested in subscribing to a hypothetical newsletter, 
                        or to contact them for help on certain topics or just a business inquiry. 
                        </p>
