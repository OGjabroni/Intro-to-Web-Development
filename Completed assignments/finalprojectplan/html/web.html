                    <p>Some of the websites I've included as inspiration, (not so much for myself as I don't understand the content -yet) were sent to my by Maria, who frequents these websites for tips, tricks and tutorials. </p>
    
    
                    <p><a href="https://mateuszdabrowski.pl/">Mateusz Dabrowski</a> 
                        
                        This is a coding guy website and it's appearance is quite simple, with the same or similar to a  colour scheme in VSC, 
                        and this website is very responsive as you scale through the pixels. 
                        The site is easy to navigate, easy to find all the links you need, either through the menu, or through the expanded footer menu. Additionally, I noticed this guy's css is 3836 lines long, so I do a deeper dive into how it all works together.  </p>
                        
                        
                        
                        <p><a href="https://mc.chat/">Eliot Harper</a> 
                        
                        
                            “Eliot is the most knowledgeable person in SFMC world”- according to Maria. This fella has been her go to guy for all this Salesforce and frequents his site for his explainer videos, and owns several of his (autographed) books. 
                            The site is simple and straight to the point; videos are prominent, with a simple yet pleasant colour scheme. The videos are broken up into topics, and separated accordingly. I enjoy the sites simple layout and uncluttered scheme. </p>

                    <h3 class="lightblue">&lt;A Website I personally enjoy&gt;</h3>
                    <p>It's probably the Government of Canada Vancouver <a href="https://weather.gc.ca/city/pages/bc-74_metric_e.html"> weather forecast site</a>, as its the most simple, easy to navigate and to the point weather page. There are no ads, and the layout hasn't changed in years. 
                        I don't have to figure out how to navigate it like other websites that “evolve” over time. It's unchanging and effective. I am crotchety for age 34.</p>

                    <h3>Colour Inspiration</h3>
                    <p>The colour scheme that inspires me (meaning the client (maria) is requesting something like this) is the <a href="https://mateuszdabrowski.pl/">Mateusz Dabrowski site</a>. 
                        I think i will make a few changes to the colours for the final project, but I've made this page similar in colours.

                    <p>One of the pages I enjoy the layout of is the <a href="https://ampscript.xyz/">AMPscript
                        & SSJS site</a>. It's big fonts, lots of space and easy to read. There's no clutter. I'm also realizing that I have adblocker on so this may not be everyone's experience. </p>
