		<h1>Team Macgruber</h1>
		<h2>Magruber</h2>
		<img src="images\macgrubertitle.jpg" >
		<ul>
			<li>Directed by: Jorma Taccone</li>
			<li>Released 2010</li>
		</ul>
	<h3>Starring</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Will Forte</li>
		<li>Kristen Wiig</li>
		<li>Ryan Phillippe</li>
		<li>Val Kilmer</li>
	</ul>
		<p>  First of all, let's talk about the titular character, MacGruber, played by the incomparable Will Forte. <img src="images\macgruber1.jpg">
			This guy is a true visionary. He's like the love child of James Bond, MacGyver, and a pack of dynamite, and his mission is to save the world. But he's also a bit of a doofus, and that's where the magic happens.</p>		
		<p>The plot? Well, it's there, I guess. Something about nuclear warheads and a villain named Dieter Von Cunth, played by Val Kilmer in a performance that is nothing short of jaw-droppingly bizarre.
			 It's like he walked onto the set and said, "I'm going to be the weirdest thing in this movie," and he succeeded with flying colors.</p>

		<p>Kristen Wigg is in the movie</p>
			
		<p>But what truly sets MacGruber apart is its fearless commitment to absurdity. It's like they said, "You know what this movie needs? A montage of MacGruber and his team dancing to 'Take Me Home Tonight'
			by Eddie Money in a cemetery. And they did it! And it's glorious!</p> 
		
		<img src="images\macgrubercelery.jpg">

		<p> And let's not forget the celery, folks. MacGruber has an inexplicable obsession with celery sticks, and it becomes a running gag that will have you questioning the very nature of comedy itself. 
			I mean, celery has never been this funny, and I doubt it ever will be again.</p> 

		<p> MacGruber is a cinematic masterpiece that defies all expectations and delivers pure, unadulterated hilarity. It's a surrealist's dream come true, a triumph of absurdity, and a testament to the power of celery. 
			If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor and experience the brilliance that is MacGruber</p>
